# Visual Search Engine

A powerful Visual Search Engine that allows users to find images using text queries or visual similarity search powered by deep learning.

---

## Features

- Text Search – Find images using keywords, tags, or descriptions  
- Visual Search – Upload an image to discover visually similar images  
- Modern UI – Elegant, responsive interface with smooth animations  
- Drag & Drop – Intuitive image upload experience  
- Deep Learning – Uses VGG16 for image feature extraction  
- Fast Search – Powered by Elasticsearch for efficient text and vector queries

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Elasticsearch 8.x
- TensorFlow 2.12.0

---

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visual-search-engine.git
cd visual-search-engine
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Elasticsearch

1. Download and install Elasticsearch from [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
2. Start the Elasticsearch service
3. Verify it’s running on: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)

---

### 4. Configure Image Directory

Edit the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` path in `app.py` to point to your image dataset:

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = r"D:/Search_with_images/images"
```

---

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

---

### 6. Access the Web App

Open your browser and navigate to:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Usage

### Text Search

1. Open the Text Search tab
2. Enter keywords or tags
3. Click Search or press Enter
4. View the matching image results

### Visual Search

1. Open the Image Search tab
2. Drag and drop an image or click to browse
3. The system finds and displays visually similar images
4. Click any image to view it in full

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`                           | Main interface                     |
| POST   | `/extract_features`           | Extract image features using VGG16 |
| POST   | `/search`                     | Search for similar images          |
| GET    | `/search_text`                | Search images by text query        |
| GET    | `/images/<folder>/<filename>` | Serve images from directory        |

## How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction (Deep Learning):**
   Each image is processed through a pre-trained **VGG16** model to extract high-dimensional feature vectors representing its visual content.

2. **Indexing (Elasticsearch):**
   These features, along with metadata such as image name or tags, are stored in **Elasticsearch**, enabling fast similarity and text-based searches.

3. **Searching:**

   * For **text search**, Elasticsearch retrieves images that match the query keywords.
   * For **visual search**, the system computes features for the uploaded image and finds the closest matches in the feature index using vector similarity.

4. **Results Display:**
   Flask serves the matched images and renders them dynamically in the browser through the frontend interface.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Flask, TensorFlow, Elasticsearch
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Machine Learning Model:** VGG16 (for image feature extraction)
* **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch (for text and vector search)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Elasticsearch not running**

* Start the Elasticsearch service
* Check that port 9200 is available

**Image not found**

* Verify the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` path in `app.py`
* Check image file permissions

**Import errors**

* Ensure all dependencies are installed
* Confirm Python version is 3.8 or higher

---

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `app.py` for development:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host="127.0.0.1", port=5000)
```
